# ABSTRACT 
 As the name specifies “HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is a 
software developed for managing various activities in the hostel. For the past 
few years, the number of educational institutions are increasing rapidly. Thereby 
the number of hostels are also increasing for the accommodation of the 
students studying in this institution. And hence there is a lot of strain on the 
person who are running the hostel and software’s are not usually used in this 
context. This particular project deals with the problems on managing a hostel 
and avoids the problems which occur when carried manually. 
 Identification of the drawbacks of the existing system leads to the 
designing of computerized system that will be compatible to the existing system 
with the system Which is more user friendly and more GUI oriented. We can 
improve the efficiency of the system, thus overcome the drawbacks of the 
existing system. 
 Less human error 
 Strength and strain of manual labour can be reduced 
 High security 
 Data redundancy can be avoided to some extent 
 Data consistency 
 Easy to handle 
 Easy data updating 
 Easy record keeping 

# INTRODUCTION 
 This Hostel Management System is developed in favour of the 
hostel management team which helps them to save the records of the students 
about their rooms and other things. It helps them from the manual work from 
which it is very difficult to find the record of the students and the information 
about those ones who had left the hostel years before.
 This solution is developed on the plight of the hostel management 
team, through this they cannot require so efficient person to handle and 
manage the affairs of the students in the hostel, all you need to do is to login as 
administrator and you can see the information of all the students who have 
obtained and registered their hostel form, click verify to ascertain their eligibility 
and allocate them to the available hostel. 
 Identification of the problems of the existing hostel management 
leads to the development of computerized solution that will be compatible to 
the existing hostel management with the solution which is more users friendly 
and more GUI oriented. We can improve the efficiency of the hostel 
management, thus overcome the drawbacks of the existing management.
